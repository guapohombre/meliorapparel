              Laura is the only person in North America with a master's degree
              in lingerie design. She is the founder of
              <a href="//www.bravolution.com/" target="_blank" alt="Bravolution"
                >Bravolution</a
              >&#174;, a consultancy dedicated to enhancing bra design for major
              brands while educating consumers.
            </p>

            <p class="founder-body">
              While working in the apparel industry, Laura fit bras more than
              1,500 times and learned about the pain, discomfort, and shame
              women feel when wearing bras. She shared their frustration.
            </p>

            <p class="founder-body">
              In 2019, Laura shared her bra knowledge in a

              that has since been viewed by over 3 million people.
            </p>

            <p class="founder-body">
              Laura found that folks in the apparel industry weren't willing to
              take risks and embrace her ideas to replace the bra - or at least
              make the bra radically better. This motivated her to start her own
              apparel company focused and comfort and beauty.
